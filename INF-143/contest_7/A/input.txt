A man was pulled over for driving too fast, even though he thought he was driving just fine.

Officer: You were speeding.
Man: No, I was not.
Officer: Yes, you were. I am giving you a ticket.
Man: But I was not speeding.
Officer: Tell that to the judge! (The officer gives man the ticket.)
Man: Would I get another ticket if I called you a jerk?
Officer: Yes, you would.
Man: What if I just thought that you were?
Officer: I can not give you a ticket for what you think.
Man: Fine, I think you are a jerk!
